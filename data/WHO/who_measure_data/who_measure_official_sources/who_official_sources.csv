The protocol provides the recommendations of how funerals should be performed, the handling of the cadaver in hospitals, at home and in public space. The document serves to guide the health teams of legal and funeral medicine.
According to the protocol, those who died due to COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but funerals and funerals of confirmed or suspected patients of the disease, who join many people in a closed environment, are not recommended. In this case, the risk of transmission is also associated with contact between family and friends.
Therefore, the burial ceremony should take place in ventilated and preferably open places. In addition, the recommendation is that it has a maximum of 10 people, respecting the minimum distance of at least two meters between them, as well as other measures of social isolation and respiratory etiquette. This recommendation should be observed during periods with indication of social isolation or quarantine by the local or federal manager.
Throughout the wake the coffin should remain closed to avoid any contact with the body. The protocol also recommends that the permanence of people belonging to the risk group be avoided: age equal to or greater than 60 years, pregnant women, lactating women, patients with chronic diseases and immunosuppressed diseases. In addition, the presence of people with respiratory symptoms should also be avoided, such as fever and cough.
If the person confirmed or suspected of coronavirus infection dies at home it is necessary to report the death immediately to the health service, such as to the Fire Department or the Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU 192), or even to the family's trusted physician, that should not have contact with the body. People living with the deceased should receive disinfection guidance for environments and objects, using bleach.

assessment of inventory and use of personal protective equipment;
strengthening of data reporting systems;
