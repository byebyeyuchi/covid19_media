The research, published 14 April 2020 in the journal Science, predicted several scenarios for how the coronavirus might spread over the next five years, taking into account factors such as whether or not the virus will exhibit seasonality, whether people who are infected go on to develop short-term or long-term immunity, and whether people would get any cross-protective immunity from having been infected with other types of coronaviruses that cause common colds. 
The study shows Even if one 8- to 12-week period of social distancing is successful in “flattening the curve”—keeping the infection rate low enough so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—many people will remain susceptible to COVID-19. And Social distancing restrictions could be eased under various scenarios, according to the authors—if COVID-19 treatments become available, if hospitals can increase their intensive care bed capacity, if there’s aggressive contact tracing and quarantine, or if a vaccine is developed.",,,,Media,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/intermittent-social-distancing-may-be-needed-through-2022-to-manage-covid-19/,,2020-04-20,,2020-04-20,9261

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.      The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.      The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.      New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.      Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.      Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.   https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101",Required,,,,,,2020-03-27,,,9261

The doctors have launched two multi-site inpatient and outpatient clinical trials involving the drug Losartan. The doctors believe Losartan, which is readily available, cheap and FDA-approved, will block receptors, or cell doorways, that the chemical angiotensin II uses to elevate blood pressure, which in excess can lead to lung damage. The hope is that Losartan might bind to an enzyme and block the extra angiotensin II, thereby preventing the lung injury. 
The first trial involves 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19-related pneumonia. The inpatient trial, funded by the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator Fund, will take place at M Health Fairview's Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul and HCMC. The doctors expect to add 5 to 10 sites nationwide in coming weeks.
Funded by the Minnesota Partnership, an outpatient trial for patients with less serious symptoms will enroll 500 patients at M Health Fairview hospitals, the Mayo Clinic and HCMC. The doctors are seeking funding to expand the outpatient trial nationally.",,,,Media,https://gphin.canada.ca/cepr/showarticle.jsp?docId=1006820234,,2020-04-23,,2020-04-23,9261

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101",Required,,,,,,2020-03-19,,,9261

The research, published 14 April 2020 in the journal Science, predicted several scenarios for how the coronavirus might spread over the next five years, taking into account factors such as whether or not the virus will exhibit seasonality, whether people who are infected go on to develop short-term or long-term immunity, and whether people would get any cross-protective immunity from having been infected with other types of coronaviruses that cause common colds. 
The study shows Even if one 8- to 12-week period of social distancing is successful in “flattening the curve”—keeping the infection rate low enough so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—many people will remain susceptible to COVID-19.

The research, published 14 April 2020 in the journal Science, predicted several scenarios for how the coronavirus might spread over the next five years, taking into account factors such as whether or not the virus will exhibit seasonality, whether people who are infected go on to develop short-term or long-term immunity, and whether people would get any cross-protective immunity from having been infected with other types of coronaviruses that cause common colds. 
The study shows Even if one 8- to 12-week period of social distancing is successful in “flattening the curve”—keeping the infection rate low enough so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—many people will remain susceptible to COVID-19. And Social distancing restrictions could be eased under various scenarios, according to the authors—if COVID-19 treatments become available, if hospitals can increase their intensive care bed capacity, if there’s aggressive contact tracing and quarantine, or if a vaccine is developed.",,,,Media,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/intermittent-social-distancing-may-be-needed-through-2022-to-manage-covid-19/,,2020-04-20,,2020-04-20,9261

Limit farm entrance to essential personnel or personnel performing essential activities. Exceptions to this must be approved by the farms’ biosecurity officer and/or upper management. Essential activities are those required for the care and well-being of the animals, workers and facilities, and require prompt attention.
Persons who are sick or have signs of illness (e.g. fever, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, tiredness, shortness of breath) should stay home and call a doctor or healthcare provider.
Avoid close physical contact such as shaking hands or hugging when greeting co-workers. Avoid travel outside work. Do not carpool or limit carpooling to essential situations.
Limit travel to essential locations (i.e groceries and pharmacies). Avoid large crowds (e.g. church, shopping centers and entertainment events).  
Stagger arrival of workers to the farm so they do not congregate in the common air spaces (e.g. entry hallways, showers or breakrooms).
Plan break times so that a maximum of two workers are in the same room at the same time while they maintain at least six feet distance from each other.
Avoid having groups of people in the same air space. Limit number of meetings that require face-to-face interactions and consider alternatives such as conference calls or email.
