Health centers in regions that have already identified community transmission of coronavirus, begin to adopt a new care methodology for patients who seek units with characteristic symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever along with cough, sore throat or difficulty breathing. The Ministry of Health, in partnership with the entities of the Coronavirus Emergency Operations Center (COE), created the Rapid Track tool, a care flow protocol to be used during the emergence of coronavirus . The new method will accelerate the care of suspected cases by primary care teams in health centers, preventing the circulation and contagion of the virus in these environments.
Home isolation of symptomatic patients is the main measure to reduce the transmission of the virus, in addition to the isolation of other people in the household. The selective isolation of cases and contacts is the most effective measure to date to reduce the spread of the disease, maintaining the functioning of essential services for society. On this, Minister appealed to Brazilians: ""Please, in cases of influenza, collect your family and stay in isolation. Ask the unit for the certificate, name the people who are at home with you, and stay indoors.""
Social distancing also applies to all people over 60 years of age, who should avoid attending work or other closed environments.

Adopting alternative times to avoid peak periods is also one of the measures recommended by the Ministry of Health to the states.
For educational institutions, it is recommended to plan for anticipating holidays, seeking to reduce losses in the school calendar, including the possibility of using distance learning.

The document serves to guide the health teams of legal and funeral medicine.
According to the protocol, those who died due to COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but funerals and funerals of confirmed or suspected patients of the disease, who join many people in a closed environment, are not recommended. In this case, the risk of transmission is also associated with contact between family and friends.
Therefore, the burial ceremony should take place in ventilated and preferably open places. In addition, the recommendation is that it has a maximum of 10 people, respecting the minimum distance of at least two meters between them, as well as other measures of social isolation and respiratory etiquette. This recommendation should be observed during periods with indication of social isolation or quarantine by the local or federal manager.
Throughout the wake the coffin should remain closed to avoid any contact with the body. The protocol also recommends that the permanence of people belonging to the risk group be avoided: age equal to or greater than 60 years, pregnant women, lactating women, patients with chronic diseases and immunosuppressed diseases. In addition, the presence of people with respiratory symptoms should also be avoided, such as fever and cough.
If the person confirmed or suspected of coronavirus infection dies at home it is necessary to report the death immediately to the health service, such as to the Fire Department or the Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU 192), or even to the family's trusted physician, that should not have contact with the body.
