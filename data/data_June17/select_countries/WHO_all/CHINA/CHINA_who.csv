The study authors found viral nucleotide in anal swabs or blood even when it was not detected in oral swabs, especially in patients who had been receiving supportive care for several days. The results also showed that the timing of positive swabs changed. On the first day of illness, 80% of oral swabs were positive in a small group of patients, but by day 5, 75% of anal swabs were positive, and only 50% of oral swabs were still positive in the same patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19.
These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen.
The results of the study are the first to show COVID-19 could be transmitted via respiratory, fecal-oral, or body fluid routes.

At the meeting today, members of the Scientific Committees were updated of the latest global and local situation of novel coronavirus infection. They also reviewed the current surveillance and control measures in Hong Kong.
Members agreed that there is evidence of community transmission of novel coronavirus in Hong Kong. In order to stop ongoing spread and prevent the disease from taking root locally, Hong Kong should continue to maintain the current strategy of isolating cases, quarantine of close contacts and medical surveillance of other contacts.
The Scientific Committees acknowledged that as the outbreaks in Mainland China continue to propagate, the existing measures to minimise the population movements between Hong Kong and Mainland China should remain in place and be periodically assessed.
Members also reviewed the quarantine period for contacts of confirmed cases. In view of the existing data on the incubation period of novel coronavirus, the quarantine period for close contacts is recommended to be maintained at 14 days. Members advised that when the quarantine centres have reached their full capacity, the close contacts should be quarantined in designated quarantine facilities for the first 10 days while they could be put under home quarantine for the remaining 4 days on a case-by-case basis.
The Scientific Committees recommended that the entire society should be mobilised to continue to strengthen social distancing measures, personal hygiene (including hand hygiene, cough manner, wearing a mask when having fever or respiratory symptom, etc) and environmental hygiene measures as far as practicable to minimise the further spread of the disease locally.",,,,Official,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202002/17/P2020021700723.htm,,2020-02-17,,2020-02-17,9261

They are all required to report to the health authorities and provide a lab specimen for further laboratory diagnosis. (2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis.

The ministry said that current nucleic acid detection reagents require long time, fussy operations and centralized detection. They are unable to meet the fast-growing needs of the quick testing on suspected patients and asymptomatic infections. The purpose of this guideline is to widely solicit on-site virus detection products, which can break through the limitations of existing testing technologies on personnel or places, shorten testing time, provide easier and faster operation and make rapid diagnosis of suspected patients and on-site screening of people in close contact, the ministry said. The new on-site quick testing equipment and reagents should be able to identify confirmed infection among suspected patients within 1.5 hours, according to the guideline. The ministry, together with the national medical products watchdog, will support the development of qualified candidate projects. Research institutes, universities and enterprises can submit applications to the ministry from 8 to 13 February
To help prevent and control the epidemic, the ministry has so far launched three batches of 16 emergency sci-tech projects, including virus tracking and the development of drugs, vaccines and testing reagents.
