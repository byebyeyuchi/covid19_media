Also asked to do so were people feeling lethargic or breathing difficulties severer than such conditions for influenza. The recommendation was included in a set of guidelines announced the same day as rough indications for when a person should reach out to the consultation offices if they develop fever or other symptoms. 
The ministry advised elderly people, those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, and heart and respiratory problems, people on dialysis, those using immunosuppressive or anticancer drugs, and pregnant women to use the consultation services if their suspected new coronavirus symptoms continue for around two days, because their conditions could rapidly deteriorate if they are infected with the COVID-19 virus.
It called for cases involving children to be handled in the same way as that for a normal adult since there have been no reports of symptoms of children infected with the virus tending to become severe.
The guidelines call on people beginning to show cold-like symptoms, such as fever, to stay home from school or work and refrain from going outside, and check and record their body temperature every day before using the COVID-19 consultation offices or visiting a medical institution.
They are asked to only visit medical institutions recommended by the special consultation offices and thoroughly take necessary measures, including washing their hands and wearing face masks.
The special consultation offices are at 536 places in the nation, and they handle consultations for 24 hours a day as much as they can, according to the ministry.
