Overall, case spread has levelled off in several provinces, though cases in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta are driving the current epidemic growth.

Canada continues to track within the range of between one per cent and 10 per cent of Canadians becoming infected with COVID-19.

22,000 people could die. If that grows further to 10 per cent of the population, approximately 44,000 people in Canada could die.

That way the ""clean"" team can hear what is going on in the room at all times and can also talk back to those in the room.
