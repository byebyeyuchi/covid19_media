The scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. Emerging evidence suggests that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be spreading virus without recognizing, or prior to recognizing, symptoms. This would make disease control measures that were effective against SARS-CoV-1 less effective against its successor. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary cases of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be occurring in community settings rather than healthcare settings.

Limit farm entrance to essential personnel or personnel performing essential activities. Exceptions to this must be approved by the farms’ biosecurity officer and/or upper management. Essential activities are those required for the care and well-being of the animals, workers and facilities, and require prompt attention.
Persons who are sick or have signs of illness (e.g. fever, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, tiredness, shortness of breath) should stay home and call a doctor or healthcare provider.
Avoid close physical contact such as shaking hands or hugging when greeting co-workers. Avoid travel outside work. Do not carpool or limit carpooling to essential situations.
Limit travel to essential locations (i.e groceries and pharmacies). Avoid large crowds (e.g. church, shopping centers and entertainment events).  
Stagger arrival of workers to the farm so they do not congregate in the common air spaces (e.g. entry hallways, showers or breakrooms).
Plan break times so that a maximum of two workers are in the same room at the same time while they maintain at least six feet distance from each other.
Avoid having groups of people in the same air space. Limit number of meetings that require face-to-face interactions and consider alternatives such as conference calls or email.

Chan School of Public Health, entiled ""Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the postpandemic period.""
The research, published 14 April 2020 in the journal Science, predicted several scenarios for how the coronavirus might spread over the next five years, taking into account factors such as whether or not the virus will exhibit seasonality, whether people who are infected go on to develop short-term or long-term immunity, and whether people would get any cross-protective immunity from having been infected with other types of coronaviruses that cause common colds. 
The study shows Even if one 8- to 12-week period of social distancing is successful in “flattening the curve”—keeping the infection rate low enough so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—many people will remain susceptible to COVID-19. And Social distancing restrictions could be eased under various scenarios, according to the authors—if COVID-19 treatments become available, if hospitals can increase their intensive care bed capacity, if there’s aggressive contact tracing and quarantine, or if a vaccine is developed.

Conversely, models that do not incorporate strong contact reduction (CU 20%, CU 30%) suggest a more rapid rise in deaths.

United States,5/7/2020,Media,1006920172,"According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, two to four of every 10,000 US adults may need hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, if events similar to those in Wuhan, China, unfold there. The authors indicated that the need for health care resources might be higher in some US cities, where there is a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations than in Wuhan. According to the researchers, when the number of coronavirus patients needing hospitalization in Wuhan exceeded system capacity, they were put into home isolation, spreading the disease as they and their family members sought care at different hospitals. Outstripping of hospital capacity in Wuhan also led to rationing of healthcare resources such as ventilators, leading to a high case-fatality rate of 4.5%, versus 3.2% for the rest of Hubei province and 0.8% elsewhere in China, where strict lockdown measures were implemented early. The investigators observed that lockdowns in Wuhan and Guangzhou did not lead to an immediate reduction in hospital use or the number of critical cases, which peaked a month after Wuhan locked down and 2 weeks after Guangzhou did so. This delay reflects the potentially long time from infection to severe and critical condition, as many patients with COVID-19 who eventually require ICU care present initially with only mild symptoms, and an even longer time to discharge or death, resulting in the accumulation of hospitalized cases long after downturns in community spread. The comparative findings suggest that strict disease control strategies should be implemented early to mitigate the demand for inpatient and intensive care unit beds during a COVID-2019 outbreak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/05/study-wuhan-covid-19-scenario-could-crush-us-hospitals,

In the new study, researchers from the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources and his colleagues have tried to move forward in this regard.
