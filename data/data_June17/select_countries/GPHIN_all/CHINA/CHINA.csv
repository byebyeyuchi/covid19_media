But when the scientists found that three more-ancestral haplotypes — H3, H13 and H38 — appeared in several cases with no reported ties to the market, including one in the southern city of Shenzhen and another in the United States.

The first-of-its-kind global survey was jointly conducted by Singapore's leading social research agency Blackbox Research and technology company Toluna between 3-19 April. The survey measured the sentiments of approximately 12,500 people from 23 countries and regions towards their governments' COVID-19 crisis management efforts. The survey was assessed using four key performance indicators: political leadership, corporate leadership, community, and media.
The result revealed that Chinese mainland came in first with an index score of 85, with the most respondents rating its performance favorably across the four indicators. Vietnam came in second (77), followed by a tie between the United Arab Emirates and India (59). New Zealand (56) is the only Western country with an index score higher than the global average of 45, indicating that citizens in Western countries are generally less satisfied with their countries' performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.china.org.cn/world/2020-05/15/content_76048302.htm,
