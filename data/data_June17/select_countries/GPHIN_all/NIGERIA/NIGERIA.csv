Nigeria,4/30/2020,Official,,"As infection has spread to more states the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) began ramping up testing capacity. As of 30 April 2020, there are now 17 laboratories and plans are afoot to set up one laboratory in each of the 36 states. Widespread testing sits at the heart of Nigeria’s COVID-19 battle. According to the  NCDC Director-General, Over the next three months, the NCDC aims to test about two million people. Nigeria is currently testing 4000 samples per week. Authorities are also working with PEPFAR (The Unites States President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) and the national tuberculosis network to integrate existing technologies and resources. Meanwhile, in Lagos state, the epicentre of the outbreak in Nigeria, multipartner response teams are working hard to support the state to scale up sample collection, a key requirement to enabling increased testing. A decentralized approach at local government area (an administrative unit) level allows for easier sample collection at the community level. Lagos state is currently increasing the number of hospitals available by re-modelling existing facilities and building additional facilities. In addition, an epidemiologist with WHO, is working with a team to enhance surveillance in communities and in health facilities.

In order to reduce the incidence of cases coming in and then forming clusters of new infections, the provision has now changed to what we call isolation-one or quarantine.
