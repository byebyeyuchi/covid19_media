In this new space, actions will also be carried out in the Solidarity clinical trial ( Solidarity ), of the World Health Organization (WHO). The initiative, which will receive an investment of R $ 4 million from the Ministry of Health, aims to investigate the effectiveness of four treatments for COVID-19. The space will have 200 exclusive beds for intensive and semi-intensive treatment for critically ill patients infected with the coronavirus. The construction of the Fiocruz Hospital Center will be divided into two stages, the first of which will take 40 days and will have 100 beds, 50 for intensive care and 50 for semi-intensive care. The expectation is that, at the end of two months, the entire work, with a total of 200 beds, is already completed.
All the beds in the Center will be isolated for aerosol infections (light particles that are suspended in the air) and will be operated under conditions of assistance for highly complex patients. The hospital unit will also have a diagnostic support system for all necessary tests, including imaging, such as computed tomography. The new Hospital Center will function as a reference center, not offering the spontaneous demand of the state. Access will be through the regulatory system of the State of Rio de Janeiro.
The COVID-19 Pandemic Hospital Center will also have an extra workforce. The Foundation for Scientific and Technological Development in Health (Fiotec) will invite professionals to work on the new initiative. In this first phase there will be about 600 vacancies for doctors, nurses, nursing technicians and physiotherapists. In a second step, nutritionists, psychologists, social workers and specialists such as cardiologists and nephrologists, and administrative support professionals will also be invited.

The findings, from an international study led by Brazilian researchers, were described in an article published on the medRxiv platform. According to the study, the average age reported in Brazil was lower than that observed in other countries, and it could be associated to the fact that in the early phase of the epidemic most of the patients infected with COVID-19 belonged to the higher social classes, who had travelled associated infections. This factor may have contributed to a hospitalization rate equivalent to half of the international average (10% in Brazil, versus 20% of other countries). The researchers analyzed the cases registered in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, based on data from geolocation of the patients' address. The analyses revealed that the regions with the highest average per capita income had higher test rates. The researchers also observed that during the first month of the epidemic, only 33.1% of cases were confirmed in public health laboratories and the remaining cases were tested in private laboratories. Data analysis indicated that from 25 February to 25 March 2020, 1,468 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Brazil, of which almost half (48%) people between 20 and 39 years of age.
