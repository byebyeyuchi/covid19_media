The ministry, together with the national medical products watchdog, will support the development of qualified candidate projects. Research institutes, universities and enterprises can submit applications to the ministry from 8 to 13 February
To help prevent and control the epidemic, the ministry has so far launched three batches of 16 emergency sci-tech projects, including virus tracking and the development of drugs, vaccines and testing reagents.
A number of research teams across China are developing or have developed testing products for the novel coronavirus.

More clusters of virus transmission are being confirmed. While this is an indication of an alert and effective surveillance, it also puts the spotlight on the need for more aggressive and whole of society efforts to prevent further spread of COVID-19. WHO Regional Director stated that clearly there is need to do more, and urgently. Looking at the numbers, some countries are clearly heading towards community transmission of COVID-19, adding this should best be prevented. Of critical importance are continued efforts to detect, test, treat, isolate and trace contacts. However, if community transmission does set in, countries would need to gear their responses to slow down transmission, as well as end outbreaks. Emergency mechanism would then need to be further scaled up. A network of health facilities and hospitals for triage and surge would need to be activated to avoid overcrowding. Self-initiated isolation by people with mild diseases would continue to be the most important community intervention to reduce the burden on health system and reduce virus transmission. Testing of all suspected cases, symptomatic contacts of probable and confirmed cases, would still be needed, concluded the WHO Regional Director.

United States,3/18/2020,Official,,"According to a new study from National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University scientists in The New England Journal of Medicine, the virus that causes COVID-19 is stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces. The scientists found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. Emerging evidence suggests that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be spreading virus without recognizing, or prior to recognizing, symptoms. This would make disease control measures that were effective against SARS-CoV-1 less effective against its successor. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary cases of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be occurring in community settings rather than healthcare settings.  However, healthcare settings are also vulnerable to the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces likely contributes to transmission of the virus in healthcare settings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces,

According to the protocol, those who died due to COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but funerals and funerals of confirmed or suspected patients of the disease, who join many people in a closed environment, are not recommended. In this case, the risk of transmission is also associated with contact between family and friends.
Therefore, the burial ceremony should take place in ventilated and preferably open places. In addition, the recommendation is that it has a maximum of 10 people, respecting the minimum distance of at least two meters between them, as well as other measures of social isolation and respiratory etiquette. This recommendation should be observed during periods with indication of social isolation or quarantine by the local or federal manager.
Throughout the wake the coffin should remain closed to avoid any contact with the body. The protocol also recommends that the permanence of people belonging to the risk group be avoided: age equal to or greater than 60 years, pregnant women, lactating women, patients with chronic diseases and immunosuppressed diseases. In addition, the presence of people with respiratory symptoms should also be avoided, such as fever and cough.

European Union,4/9/2020,Official,,"On 8 Apri, ECDC released the 8th update on its rapid risk assessment, as the following: 
1) The risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered moderate for the general population and very high for populations with defined risk factors associated with elevated risk;  2) the risk of increasing community transmission of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is moderate if mitigation measures are in place, and very high if insufficient mitigation measures are in place; 3) The risk of health and social care system capacity in the EU/EEA and the UK being exceeded in the coming weeks is considered high with mitigation measures in place and very high if insufficient mitigation measures are in place.
In the current situation, a strong focus should remain on comprehensive testing and surveillance strategies (including contact tracing), community measures (including physical distancing), strengthening of healthcare systems and informing the public and health community. 
ECDC warns that urrent estimates suggest that no EU/EEA country is close to achieving the necessary population protection threshold, meaning that sustained transmission of the virus is to be expected if current interventions are lifted too quickly. In the absence of a vaccine, physical distancing measures of some kind will therefore need to remain in place for at least some months, in order to ensure that demand for healthcare does not exceed availability. 
ECDC stresses that plans for de-escalation should therefore ensure that appropriate capacities and safeguards, based on public health principles underscored by scientific evidence, are in place to mitigate the risk of an overwhelming recurrence of increased transmission and the risk to vulnerable members of the population.  Based on the available evidence, it is currently too early to start lifting all community and physical distancing measures in the EU/EEA and the UK.

WHO,5/8/2020,Official,,"WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence – including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response.
Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear – if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported.
WHO has three messages: 1. To governments and local authorities: This should not be considered an ‘option’. It should be considered a moral obligation to make sure services to address violence are available and resourced, and expand hotlines and online services; 2. To communities and the public: Violence is not a private matter –  stay in touch, contact and support your neighbours, acquaintances, families and friends. If you see something, say something. 3. To those experiencing violence: Violence against you is never your fault. It is never your fault. Your home should be a secure place. Get in touch -safely- with family, friends, shelters or community groups that have your safety and security at heart.
The measures required to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 have challenged our ability to prevent and respond to violence when and where it occurs. However, there are examples where countries have addressed this. Italy has an app to ask for help without a phone call. Pharmacists in Spain and France can be alerted through codewords. Hotels in France and Belgium have been converted to shelters. Greenland has limited the sale of alcohol to make the home environment safer for children. Also, sharing information on where to get help, increasing awareness of the signs of violence, expanding helplines, maintaining programmes on social and parenting skills, following up on pre-existing situations can all make a positive difference.

This research brought together five teams of modellers using different mathematical models to analyse the effects of various possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by COVID-19. The impact of a six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could effectively set the clock on AIDS-related deaths back to 2008, when more than 950,000 AIDS-related deaths were observed in the region. In addition, people would continue to die from the disruption in large numbers for at least another five years, with an annual average excess in deaths of 40% over the next half a decade. HIV service disruptions could also have some impact on HIV incidence in 2021. Other significant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the AIDS response in sub-Saharan Africa that could lead to additional mortality include reduced quality clinical care owing to health facilities becoming overstretched and a suspension of viral load testing, reduced adherence counselling and drug regimen switches. The research highlights the need for urgent efforts to ensure the continuity of HIV prevention and treatment services in order to avert excess HIV-related deaths and to prevent increases in HIV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO,5/12/2020,Official,,"For much of the WHO European Region, health authorities need to be prepared for a long, hot summer. Weather services are expecting the coming summer to be warmer and drier than usual in the Region. The public, medical professionals and public health authorities need to be prepared for heatwaves and to prevent and tackle the possible health consequences of heat exposure. This is particularly important this year due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak compounding issues caused by extended periods of hot weather, while many people, including groups particularly vulnerable to both the infection and heat, might be advised or required to remain at home as potential lockdowns are in place. Recent studies have estimated that the heatwave probability has increased for 31 European cities (European Union capitals plus London, Moscow, Oslo and Zurich), and found that all the investigated European metropolitan areas will be more vulnerable to extreme heat in the coming decades. The scientific consensus is that climate change will increase the heat-related burden of disease if authorities do not implement strong levels of adaptation. This is also of great importance to avoid placing an additional burden on health-care systems at a time when they are already severely stretched to treat COVID-19 patients. WHO/Europe recommends countries and regions to develop and implement heat–health action plans. These plans aim to prevent, react to and contain heat-related risks to health, and they should include measures for long-term prevention, medium-term preparation and short-term emergency measures.

WHO,5/13/2020,Official,,"For much of the WHO European Region, health authorities need to be prepared for a long, hot summer. Weather services are expecting the coming summer to be warmer and drier than usual in the Region. The public, medical professionals and public health authorities need to be prepared for heatwaves and to prevent and tackle the possible health consequences of heat exposure. This is particularly important this year due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak compounding issues caused by extended periods of hot weather, while many people, including groups particularly vulnerable to both the infection and heat, might be advised or required to remain at home as potential lockdowns are in place. Recent studies have estimated that the heatwave probability has increased for 31 European cities (European Union capitals plus London, Moscow, Oslo and Zurich), and found that all the investigated European metropolitan areas will be more vulnerable to extreme heat in the coming decades. The scientific consensus is that climate change will increase the heat-related burden of disease if authorities do not implement strong levels of adaptation. This is also of great importance to avoid placing an additional burden on health-care systems at a time when they are already severely stretched to treat COVID-19 patients. WHO/Europe recommends countries and regions to develop and implement heat–health action plans. These plans aim to prevent, react to and contain heat-related risks to health, and they should include measures for long-term prevention, medium-term preparation and short-term emergency measures. In 2020, in particular, it is recommended that even existing heat–health action plans be reviewed to take into consideration measures in place to reduce and prevent COVID-19 transmission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/Climate-change/news/news/2020/5/preparing-for-a-long,-hot-summer-with-covid-19",

In the investigation, officials noted that following a 2.5-hour choir practice attended by 61 persons, including a symptomatic index patient, 32 confirmed and 20 probable secondary COVID-19 cases were reported (attack rate = 53.3% to 86.7%), including three patients who were hospitalized, and two deaths. This outbreak of COVID-19 with a high secondary attack rate indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might be highly transmissible in certain settings, including group-singing events. The study shows that the transmission was likely facilitated by close proximity (within 6 feet) during practice and augmented by the act of singing. The authors conclude that the potential for superspreader events underscores the importance of physical distancing, including avoiding gathering in large groups, to control spread of COVID-19. Enhancing community awareness can encourage symptomatic persons and contacts of ill persons to isolate or self-quarantine to prevent ongoing transmission.

European Uninon (EU),5/15/2020,Official,,"ECDC has released a rapid risk assessment on paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome and SARS -CoV-2 infection in children. In total, about 230 suspected cases of this new paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) have been reported in EU/EEA countries and the UK in 2020, including two fatalities, one in the UK and one in France. These cases are being further investigated. So far, epidemiological studies have shown that children appear to be less affected by COVID-19. Only 2.1% of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) were in the age group between 0 and 14 years of age.
To date, an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this new clinical entity of multisystem inflammation has not yet been established, although an association appears plausible. At current, the risk is assessed as follows: the overall risk of COVID-19 in children in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered low, based on low probability of COVID-19 in children and a moderate impact of such disease. The overall risk of PIMS-TS in children in the EU/EEA and the UK – is considered low, based on a very low probability of PIMS-TS in children and a high impact of such disease. ECDC has agreed with the EU/EAA Member States and the UK to include PIMS as a possible complication to be reported for EU-level COVID-19 surveillance. Research efforts should aim at a) determining the role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of PIMS-TS and b) answering other significant remaining questions.

Israel,5/15/2020,Official,1006991950," Israeli researchers have developed a physical coronavirus breath test, providing results within one minute, Ben-Gurion University (BGU). Most current biological methods take several hours and even days, and require complex logistical steps to transfer sensitive and contagious samples to test labs. However, the new physical method developed by BGU researchers allows the most rapid result in a simple method, with high accuracy. The developers estimate that the cost of each test will not exceed 50 U.S. dollars.
Clinical trials of the new method, conducted by BGU and Israel's Ministry of Defense on 120 subjects, showed a success of over 90 percent. The new electro-optic method includes a tiny, seven-centimeter-long kit with a mouthpiece and a capsule that contains an electronic chip with a dense array of engineered sensors. First, samples are collected by a simple exhalation, then cling to the sensors. Then, the entire chip is put in a system that scans the samples and delivers the result just 20 seconds after the scan began. The device also automatically backs up the results to a database that can be accessed by the authorities to facilitate monitoring the virus path, as well as prioritizing and treating patients. This may help conduct tests at entrances of airports, factories and large companies and thus help countries restore their economies to full activity.",,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-05/14/content_76041803.htm,
