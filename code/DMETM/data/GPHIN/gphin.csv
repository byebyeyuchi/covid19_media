Flights from the Asian power bring at least 1,000 travelers to the continent each day. 
But as of this week, only six labs could test for the novel coronavirus. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar, the region's top biomedical research facility, and another lab in Sounth Africa are the only two on the continent that had testing capabilities before Nigeria, Ghana, Madagascar and Sierra Leone received the supplies this week. 
To address that concern, on 6 February, medical teams from 15 African nations are convening in Dakar for an emergency workshop on the first layer of readiness: diagnosing the new virus. WHO officials said 24 countries, encompassing most of Africa's population, will receive the material needed to conduct the tests by the end of the week. 
Countries with large numbers of travelers arriving from China are screening at airports with thermal monitors and isolating anyone who shows symptoms. Mozambique stopped issuing visas for Chinese nationals. South Africa's postal service no longer accepted packages from China.

They found that all the samples with a reported link to the market contained the same haplotype, which they called H1. But when the scientists found that three more-ancestral haplotypes — H3, H13 and H38 — appeared in several cases with no reported ties to the market, including one in the southern city of Shenzhen and another in the United States.

The ministry advised elderly people, those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, and heart and respiratory problems, people on dialysis, those using immunosuppressive or anticancer drugs, and pregnant women to use the consultation services if their suspected new coronavirus symptoms continue for around two days, because their conditions could rapidly deteriorate if they are infected with the COVID-19 virus.
It called for cases involving children to be handled in the same way as that for a normal adult since there have been no reports of symptoms of children infected with the virus tending to become severe.

They are asked to only visit medical institutions recommended by the special consultation offices and thoroughly take necessary measures, including washing their hands and wearing face masks.

WHO,2/14/2020,Media,1006312598,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published an article on the difference between the flu and the illness caused by the latest novel coronavirus known as COVID-19.
According to the WHO, people with COVID-19 infection, the flu, or a cold typically develop respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough and runny nose. Even though many symptoms are alike, they are caused by different viruses.
Because of their similarities, it can be difficult to identify the disease based on symptoms alone. Therefore, laboratory tests are required to confirm if someone has COVID-19.
The WHO recommends that people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should seek medical care early. Patients should inform health care providers if they have travelled in the 14 days before they developed symptoms, or if they have been in close contact with someone who has been sick with respiratory symptoms.
As for the incubation period of the current novel coronavirus epidemic, the WHO said the current estimates of the incubation period range from 1 to 12.5 days with median estimates of 5-6 days.

For the first three categories, countries must focus on finding, testing, treating and isolating individual cases, and following their contacts. 
In areas with community spread, testing every suspected case and tracing their contacts becomes more challenging. Action must be taken to prevent transmission at the community level to reduce the epidemic to manageable clusters. Depending on their context, countries with community transmission could consider closing schools, cancelling mass gatherings and other measures to reduce exposure.
The fundamental elements of the response are the same for all countries:
